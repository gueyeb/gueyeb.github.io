This is my first post. Trying to get this things running. I already fixed one or two things.

- The related posts item was always present even if there was none
- The home side menu item wasn't properly highlighted ([PR #11](https://github.com/poole/lanyon/pull/11))
- AdBlock was blocking the Twitter icon in the sidebar. I had to fix this by creating a custom class...
